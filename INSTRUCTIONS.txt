In order to run the code it is fundamental to run the notebooks
with the order they were created since each notebook will'use a
dataset generated by the previous one.

The right order is:
DM_21_TASK1/dataunderstanding
DM_21_TASK1/datapreparation
DM_21_TASK2/clusteringanalysis
DM_21_TASK3/predictiveanalysis
DM_21_TASK4/sequentialpatternmining

The folder contains also the datasets and mylib folders used to
share code and files between different notebooks.

All the required libraries are in the requirements.txt  file in
the usual python's fashon.

NOTE: it you are using Jupyter Lab instead of Jupyter Notebook the 
plots generated by the plotly library may not appear. To fix this 
problem you have to install the plotlywidget extension on Jupyter Lab

NOTE: the sequential pattern mining algorithms are very computational intensive,
if when running the notebook a Index out of bounds error appears, it is due to 
the fact they are using more heap memory than they're allowed to by the OS.
On one of ours machines (with Ubuntu) the code runs fine, on the other (Mac) 
two algorithms crash due to this problem.
